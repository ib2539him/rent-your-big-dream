                                            a payment is very easy â€“ you
                                            just need to create an outgoing
                                            payment in your Online Banking
                                            and upload the invoice from your
                                            supplier. After you create an
                                            outgoing payment, it goes
                                            through the approval process
                                            and, once approved, the payment
                                            will be sent to your supplier
                                            from your Rented Company.
